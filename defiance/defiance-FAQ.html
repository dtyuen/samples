<div style="display: block;" class="faqSection">
<div class="question">
<h4>What is Defiance?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Defiance™ is a collaboration between Trion Worlds and Syfy that aims 
to be the next revolutionary step in transmedia entertainment. Both a 
massive online shooter for console and PC and a television show, 
Defiance unfolds in a single immersive universe that will evolve on a 
week-by-week basis. Simply put: this project is unlike anything that has
 ever been attempted before. The video game is a 3rd-person futuristic 
online open-world shooter where thousands of players compete for Votan 
technology that falls to the Earth in events called “Arkfalls”. You can 
choose to play as a human or alien Ark Hunter, diving into vast and 
varied gameplay and customization options that will keep you engaged for
 years to come.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>Who is developing the game?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Defiance is being developed internally by a very talented team at Trion Worlds.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>What platforms is it available on?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Defiance is available for PC, PlayStation®3 and Xbox 360®.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>Is there a Collector’s Edition?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>There is a limited-run Collector’s Edition with bonus items including
 a Hellbug statue, art book, soundtrack, in-game items, and more. There 
will also be a very limited Ultimate Edition run, complete with Defiance
 messenger bag. Check out the #buy now tab# for more details.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>Can I buy a digital version of the game?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes, we will be selling digital versions of the basic game for PC, 
PS3, and Xbox 360. There will also be a Digital Deluxe version of the 
game containing tons of digital content at an incredible value as well 
as a digital upgrade option for those customers who bought the standard 
edition and decide to upgrade to the Digital Deluxe edition.  PC and PS3
 digital versions will be available at launch.  As per Xbox Live’s 
guidelines a digital verson of the Xbox 360 game will not be available 
until 3 months after launch. Check out the Digital section of the #buy 
now tab# for more detail.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>Will there be downloadable content after the game launches?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes, both free and paid content updates are planned on a regular basis after launch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>How does the game interact with the show?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Defiance is a brand new futuristic sci fi universe created by Syfy 
and Trion Worlds in partnership.  As a joint universe there are many 
similarities such as characters, races, events etc. that they each 
share. But the game and the show also have unique identities, story 
archs and plotlines and can be enjoyed as seperate entertainment 
entities.  However, the experience of Defiance is enhanced when both 
game and show are played/watched together because there are regular show
 and game integrations that can take the form of an in-game event, 
character crossover, themed celebration etc. Details of game/show cross 
overs will be announced on Defiance.com.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>What is the plot of Defiance?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Set in the near future, Defiance introduces a completely transformed 
planet Earth inhabited by the human and alien survivors of a global 
catastrophe. Forced to live and work together, this disparate group 
struggles to build a new society among the devastation. In the game, you
 take on the role of an Ark Hunter, a treasure/bounty hunter recently 
arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area in search of valuable Votan 
technology. Almost unrecognizable after three decades of war and 
terraforming, the Bay has become a remote and wild place, home to both 
humans and Votans bent on claiming fame and fortune in the new frontier.
 In the show, the mysterious Nolan, drifting through a terraformed 
American landscape, settles in a border town where Votans and humans 
defend a fragile peace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>How do I get my Ark Hunter Rewards?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Players who are on console will be able to open their in-game menu, 
and go into settings to select the Link Account option. Once choosing 
this option, you will be provided with a code, which can be applied to 
your Trion Worlds account. Logging into your Trion Worlds account, and 
going to Settings, you will see the option to Link an Account. Here is 
where your console code will be applied to link your account. Then any 
Pre-order or Arkfall unlocks that you have earned will be redeemable on 
your console characters.</p>
<p>Players who are accessing Defiance through a different retailer such 
as Steam, will be able to launch Defiance from their provider’s game 
library, to see the Defiance patcher. As long as you are logging into 
the Defiance Patcher using your Trion Worlds account details, you should
 see any Pre-order items or Arkfall unlocks that were applied to the 
account.</p>

<h3><span>GAMEPLAY QUESTIONS</span></h3>
<div class="faqSection">
<div class="question">
<h4>Will I be able to customize my character?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes, you will be able to create your own class, modify and upgrade 
your weapons, and customize the look of your characters, vehicles, and 
more. In addition, you will have a range of perks and power choices to 
make as you progress, so no one character will be the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>What kind of multiplayer options will there be?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Defiance offers fast and furious competitive mulitplayer in all-out 
Team Deathmatch and Capture and Hold multiplayer maps, as well as the 
Shadow War: a massive open-world (and over-world!) team combat mode 
featuring incredible rewards. More information can be found in the #Game
 section#.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>Will there be co-op?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Defiance offers co-op adventures both in the form of instances and dynamic Arkfall events.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>Will I be able to play on my own?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Although Defiance supports a massive number of players in co-op and 
competitive multiplayer games, you don’t have to join a team to jump in 
and have fun. You can play as a lone wolf across the new frontier, but 
it definitely benefits you to join others in more challenging fights.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>What is EGO and how does it effect my game?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>The Environmental Guardian Online, or EGO, is a symbiotic 
neuro-muscular bionetic implant designed by Votanis Collective 
scientists. It was intended to boost the battle prowess of Votan 
soldiers. EGO implants provide combat support and supply intelligence 
and diagnostics through a complex local area network known as the 
Ark-Net. Ark hunters in the Bay Area Expedition have all been implanted.
 You will track your progress and make changes to your character via the
 EGO interface. EGO also provides you with information about enemies, 
activities, and events you encounter and briefs you on side-mission 
locations you can explore across the world.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>What are Arkfalls?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>The Arks were enormous alien ships that transported the Votans to 
Earth. During the struggles after the Votans’ arrival, the Arks were 
destroyed in near-Earth orbit, where their debris created what is known 
as the Arkbelt. From time to time, a portion of this debris enters the 
atmosphere and plummets to Earth, creating an Arkfall. The alien debris 
from the Arks frequently includes valuable resources and technology, 
making it a prime target for Ark Hunters, hellbugs, and other deadly 
scavengers. Arkfalls appear randomly either as single meteorites or as a
 cluster and can lead to very large, hectic battles depending on the 
number of players and/or boss encounters that come with them!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>What are Ark Hunter Rewards and why should I collect them?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Ark Hunter Rewards is an Ark Hunter training program outside of the 
game where players can sign up and enter unique 6 digit codes to unlock 
special in-game items &amp; rewards.  These ark fall codes are hidden in
 various Defiance promotional assets, trailers, websites etc. Players 
need to sign up to become an ark hunter on Defiance.com/arkhunter.  The 
more codes you collect and enter the more rewards you can unlock. 
#Collect and enter more codes#</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>How do I level up in Defiance?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Defiance doesn’t have levels in the typical sense of many MMOs. Your 
EGO Rating increases as you gain Experience, complete Pursuits, and 
increase your Skills.&nbsp;As your rating increases, you will find a 
greater variety of better gear in the world, and you will unlock new 
content and character benefits. In addition to EGO Rating benefits, 
gaining Experience gives you EGO Units to upgrade Perks and Abilities, 
while increasing your Weapon or Vehicle Skills improves your 
effectiveness with all weapons or vehicles of that type.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>Will there be vendors in-game?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Typically players can locate Vendors scattered around Defiance. These
 Vendors appear to be large metal containers, which allow a player to 
walk up and interact with them, and can be found typically in Friendly 
strongholds. Most vendors can be seen when a player opens their world 
map. Placing your mouse cursor over any specific Vendor seen on the Map 
should provide information on what type of items the Vendor sells, such 
as Mods, Weapons or Lock Boxes. Most Vendors in-game will allow a player
 to pay for their goods with Scrip. However, some vendors require 
specific currency to be earned by completing “Contracts” in order to 
purchase stronger and more are items. Completing contracts for different
 Factions, such as Von Bach Industries or Echelon Mercenaries allows you
 to earn currency that can be used at Vendors with items for their 
factions. Players can also find Vendors providing different special 
items which go on sale at different moments. Different items are offered
 to players randomly from these Vendors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>How can I travel quickly while in-game?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Fast Travel:</strong><br>
  Fast travel is a feature that allows players to move quickly across 
large sections of the map. In order to fast travel, you will need to 
open your map and find the blue ‘Fast Travel’ icon. After double 
clicking on the icon you will be asked if you are sure you would like to
 fast travel, confirming this notification will send you to the location
 you have selected. Fast Travel does not cost scrip.</p>
<p><strong>Extraction:</strong><br>
  When a player is immobilized or dies is combat, you will be given the 
option to extract, which will take you back to your last checkpoint. You
 can also select your character’s icon in the map, the select Extract 
option in the bottom left hand corner of screen. If you log out and then
 back into the game, you will pick up at your last extraction point.</p>
<p><strong>Stuck? Can’t use Fast Travel?:</strong><br>
  If you find yourself getting stuck while playing Defiance, you can fix 
this by logging out or quiting the game. When you return a few minutes 
later you will be at the nearest extraction point.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>I Participated in the Alpha/Beta, will I get to keep my character after launch?</h4>
<div class="answer">
<p>Players who participated in the early Alpha/Beta events will not be able to keep characters created in these early environments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question">
<h4>What races can I choose from when playing Defiance?</h4>
