            <h2>How to use Google+ in your marketing. It's all here.</h2>
            <p>Thanks for using Google+. To help you make the most of it, we created this set of guidelines to show you how you can use the Google+ name, logos, icons, and language in your marketing.
            <p>In addition to brand assets you can download and use in your materials, we've included a few examples to show you how it all comes together nicely.</p>

            <h2>Our logos and buttons.</h2>
            <p>We have two Google+ logos you can use in your marketing: The wordmark and the Google+ icon. The monotone wordmark is the primary logo. The Google+ icon is a visual shorthand for use when the wordmark doesn't fit your design. The +1 and Google+ sign-in buttons are also available here. Select one of these options to find the relevant developer information. It's that easy.</p>

                    <p class="dashed">Use the full-color wordmark.</p>

        <h2>Google Brand Features Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <div class="modal-text">
            <p>If Google approves your request to use any Google trademarks, logos, web pages, screen shots, or other distinctive features ("Google Brand Features"), you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Agreement").</p>

            <p>You agree to comply with the Guidelines for Third Party Use of Google Brand Features. So long as you do so, and provided that Google expressly approves your permission request, Google grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, royalty-free limited license to use the Google's Brand Features set forth in your corresponding Permission Request Form for the sole purpose and only for the materials set forth therein. Any use of the Google Brand Features must be accompanied by a notice that clearly indicates that the Google Brand Features are trademarks or distinctive brand features of Google Inc.</p>

            <p>Google reserves the right in its sole discretion to terminate or modify your permission to display the Google Brand Features and to take action against any use that does not conform to these terms and conditions, infringes any Google intellectual property or other right, or violates applicable law.</p>

            <p>Except as set forth above, nothing herein grants or should be deemed to grant to you any right, title or interest in or to the Google Brand Features. Your use of the Google Brand Features will inure to the benefit of Google. You agree not to challenge or assist others to challenge the Google Brand Features (except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law), and you agree not to register or attempt to register any domain names, trademarks, trade names, social media account names or other distinctive brand features that are confusingly similar to those of Google.</p>

            <p>The Google Brand Features are provided "as is" and Google disclaims any warranties either expressed or implied by law regarding the Google Brand Features, including warranties of noninfringement. Furthermore, because you are not being charged for use of the Google Brand Features, in no event shall Google be liable to you for the subject matter of this Agreement under any theory of liability including for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, exemplary or other damages arising out of this Agreement or the use of the Google Brand Features. This limitation shall apply even if Google was or should have been aware or advised of the possibility of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy stated herein. Some states do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</p>

            <p>You may not assign your rights or delegate your obligations under this Agreement without Google's prior written consent. This Agreement is not intended to benefit, nor shall it be deemed to give rise to, any rights in any third party. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. The venue for any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be in Santa Clara County, California. The parties are independent contractors. Neither party shall be deemed to be an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of the other for any purpose and neither shall have any right, power or authority to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other as a result of this Agreement. The waiver by Google of a breach of any provision hereof shall not be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, the Guidelines for Third Party Use of Google Brand Features, and the Permission Request Form, constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>
